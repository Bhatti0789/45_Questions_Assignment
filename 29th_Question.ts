/* Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that 
   check for certain fruits in your array.
   • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
   • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. If the fruit is in
   your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!*/
